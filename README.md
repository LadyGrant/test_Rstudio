# MMseqs2
## For more information on using MMseqs2 please see [SÃ¶ding Lab - MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2).
## Publication: [MMseqs2 enables sensitive protein sequence searching for the analysis of massive data sets](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3988).

Here are the MMseqs2 output headers typically included in the resulting tab-delimited files:
**Query Sequence ID:** Identifier for the sequence being queried.
**Target Sequence ID:** Identifier for the matching sequence in the database.
**Percentage Identity:** Percentage of identical matches in the alignment.
**Alignment Length:** Length of the alignment between the query and target.
**Number of Mismatches:** Number of mismatches in the alignment.
**Number of Gap Openings:** Number of gaps introduced in the alignment.
**Query Start:** Start position of the alignment on the query sequence.
**Query End:** End position of the alignment on the query sequence.
**Target Start:** Start position of the alignment on the target sequence.
**Target End:** End position of the alignment on the target sequence.
**E-value:** Statistical significance of the alignment.
**Bit Score:** Score assigned to the alignment based on similarity.
